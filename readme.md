# Machine Learning Algorithms

###### <i>"Google’s self-driving cars and robots get a lot of press, but the company’s real future is in machine learning, the technology that enables computers to get smarter and more personal"</i> - <b>Eric Schmidt (Google Chairman)</b>



# Implementation Details
For all these techniques, the following order was maintained:

1. Collecting Data
2. Analysis Data
3. Data Wrabling
4. Test & Train
5. Accuracy Check
# 
<p aling="justify">This repository was created for shown some algorithms of machine learning. It's <b>important</b> you have a high-leve Python to understanding of various machine learning algorithms. These should be sufficient to get your hands dirty. </p>

#
# Code Environment
You need use jupyter notebook and venv for run all of implementations.
- jupyter notebook (_terminal_)
